Even though I\'m not specifically\n                            looking for a job, I ran into the offer just by coincidence and it caught my eye.\n                            Since I\'ve been planning to move to Zurich for quite a while now,\n                            I was waiting for a great opportunity to come up.\n                            I must say, I instantly felt enthusiastic and excited when I came across your job offer.\n                        <\/p>\n\n                        <p>I\'m currently working as a full stack web developer at Ecrome Group AG in St. Gallen,\n                            Switzerland. My tasks consist in maintaining and developing new features for the company\'s\n                            web projects. For instance, I developed a mobile application called \"Ja, Ich Will\" for the\n                            <em>Katholische Kirche Bistum St.Gallen<\/em>. I have also been involved in working\n                            with new frameworks as AngularJs, Laravel and Ionic for hybrid mobile apps.\n                        <\/p>\n                        <p>My strong interest and passion for working in a sports-related sector roots in the past\n                            position I held at WhiteBox Office in Almazora, Spain as a web developer and sub-project\n                            manager. During my time there, I worked on very large and extensive projects such as the\n                            re-launch of the new <em>LFP<\/em> website (Liga de F\xfatbol Profesional),\n                            which won the Best Sport Website Award given away by the Spanish Ministry of Industry\n                            in 2014. I also did maintenance work on the website of the\n                            <em>Mutua Madrid Open de Tennis<\/em>, among other interesting projects.\n                        <\/p>\n\n                        <p>\n                            After finishing my Bachelor of Science in Software Engineering I have gained a lot of\n                            experience and curiosity for the latest and newest technologies. During the last three years\n                            I have worked in different projects and had many opportunities to gain experience in\n                            working with the latest technologies such as AngularJS, Jquery, HTML5, CSS3, PHP.\n                            At the same time I was able to increase my experience developing in OOP using MVC frameworks\n                            such as Laravel. Therefore, I think my curiosity and my experience could be very beneficial\n                            for your company. I take great interest in constantly improving my skills.\n                            One good example is my CV you\'ll find by <a ui-sref=\"cv\">clicking here.<\/a>\n                        <\/p>\n\n                        <p>\n                            I hope you enjoy my tailor-made CV I developed just this weekend using AngularJs and\n                            Angular Material.\n                        <\/p>\n\n                        <p>\n                            My work experience is mainly based on web development. Even though I have more experience in\n                            PHP and JavaScript/Jquery, I also have some knowledge in Java, Groovey and Grails Framework\n                            from what I\'ve learned during my time as a student in University. I also have some knowledge\n                            in C# and .Net framework thanks to classes I took back in Uni. Since you are looking for\n                            employees that always strive to improve their skills and that have a passion for what they\n                            do, I think I could easily fit in and adapt to your companies values and goals.\n                        <\/p>\n\n                        <p>\n                            I feel that I could be a valuable asset to your international and dynamic team.\n                        <\/p>\n                        <p>\n                            I hope you give me an opportunity to introduce myself to you in a job interview.\n                        <\/p>\n                        <p>\n                            I look forward to hearing from you as soon as possible.\n                        <\/p>\n\n                        <p>Kind regards,<\/p>\n\n                        <p>Albert Gracia<\/p>"
